# The impact of subsidies on housing affordability in Canada
## Overview
This paper examines the impact subsidies on the housing affordability in Canada focusing on   low income earners.  Basically, the paper utilizes data  on several categories of households obtained  for the year 2022,  comparing  household expenditure with the total income earning. A special emphasis is given on expenditure on housing with and without subsidies, exploring  both expenditure figures and  the expenditure expense as a proportion of income.  Then again, affordability of healthy food is  examined, based on the  fact that low incomes substitute healthy food with quality housing ,  when their income level cant support both.
